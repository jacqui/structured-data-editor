A Cyprus law firm representing the newly acquired company described it as a “holding company of Cyprus and Ukrainian companies of the Roshen Group, one of the largest European manufacturers of confectionery products.” The firm wrote that, though Prime Assets Partners was for “a person involved in politics,” it had “nothing to do with his political activities."" During his 2015 presidential campaign, Poroshenko had pledged to sell most of his assets, all of which were transferred to Prime Assets Capital, according to a news account. In October 2014, a Ukrainian bank in which Poroshenko owns a majority stake, International Invest Bank, wrote a reference letter to Mossack Fonseca saying that his accounts there “have been conducted properly up to our satisfaction.”"

2,story-biography,"Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s billionaire “chocolate king,” whose corporate empire includes automotive plants, a shipyard, a TV channel and the country’s largest candy company, won the presidential election of 2014 by a landslide, a result widely attributed to his political acumen. Poroshenko has adroitly shifted his political affiliations over the years and avoided being tainted by Ukraine’s long line of corrupt leaders and oligarchs. Although he vowed to oppose the oligarchs and “prevent the inappropriate influence of private interests on the state,” critics are still waiting for him to deliver. A supporter of the 2004 pro-Europe, pro-democracy Orange Revolution, he also has positioned himself as a nationalist who could pursue peaceful relations with Russia."

Although Poroshenko didn't include Prime Asset Partners in his financial disclosures, his financial advisers noted that neither Prime Asset Partners nor two related companies in Cyprus and the Netherlands hold assets. They said that the company was part of a corporate restructuring to help sell the Roshen group. The structure is in line with ""the market practice in Ukraine for businesses aiming to sell to strategic investors or to enter the capital markets, launch IPO, etc.,"" the advisers wrote. Although Poroshenko is the shareholder, his shares are managed by a licensed asset management company, and his assets have been held by an independently managed fund, Prime Asset Capital, since 2005, the advisers said. Those assets will be transferred to a ""blind trust"" once legal formalities are completed, according to the advisers."

Two other offshore companies served as Cerman Group’s director and shareholder. Documents appear to show that Cahuzac's ownership of the account was disclosed to Mossack Fonseca at the time French authorities were investigating allegations of tax fraud by Cahuzac in 2013. When Seychelles authorities questioned Mossack Fonseca about the account, the company asked for more information about Cerman Group from the firm that had originally asked to create it. That information revealed Cahuzac's involvement. Mossack Fonseca told Seychelles authorities in May 3, 2013, that they were discontinuing their business relationship with Cerman Group because of its connection to the French politician, who was a high risk “Politically Exposed Person”.

The story linked Almeyda to a corruption case and a company registered by Mossack Fonsecca. As a consequence, Mossack Fonseca resigned from representing the firm. According to Mossack Fonseca internal communications, Trei Investments Corp.was incorporated in Panama in 1999, but never paid its fees nor had any activity . The former head of Peru's intelligence agency was director and secretary of the firm from just after its creation, which dated back to when he worked as a lawyer. He appeared as the main contact for the business. In 2000 the company was sold, but Almeyda remained as a director. Though Mossack Fonseca resigned as the company's agent, the company showed up as active in the Public Registry of Panama in December 2015 with César Almeyda as one of its directors."

He later served nearly 34 months in prison in that case. He was released in 2006, then sentenced to another four years in 2007 on related charges, at least part of which he served under house arrest. Questions arose in 2010 about whether Almeyda had bank accounts in overseas tax havens, prompting him to issue a firm denial and assert that investigators in 2004 found no such overseas accounts."

20,story-narrative,"Alaa Mubarak owned the British Virgin Islands firm Pan World Investments Inc., managed by Credit Suisse. In 2011, the year in which his father resigned the Egyptian presidency and was arrested along with Alaa and another son, BVI authorities told Mossack Fonseca to freeze Pan World's assets, an order prompted by a European Union law. In 2013, Mossack Fonseca was fined $37,500 for failing to properly check into Alaa Mubarak, ""a high risk customer."" Internally, Mossack Fonseca admitted its procedures were ""seriously flawed"" as Mubarak hadn't been identified early enough. Credit Suisse, however, wrote Mossack Fonseca that Pan World's activities – ""one investment with HIG Venture Fund"" and a cash account with the bank – did not contravene Switzerland's freeze on Mubarak's assets. In 2014, a second BVI agency started investigating Mossack Fonseca and Pan World. Company employees admitted internally that they could be found ""in further breaches."" Noting they had ""very little control"" over Mubarak's company, they resigned as its agent in April 2015."

Alaa Mubarak, his brother Gamal and father were detained in April 2011, two months after Hosni Mubarak resigned the presidency in the face of a popular uprising. The men were sentenced in May 2015 to three years in jail for embezzling millions of dollars in state funds intended for the renovation of palaces. A Cairo criminal court released Alaa and his brother in October 2015, acknowledging the time they served in jail since their arrests. The brothers still face trial on charges of insider trading. Their father remains in custody in a military hospital."

A third sought information concerning ""an investigation into Criminal Offences involving misappropriation of state or public property and forgery in respect of Bainfield Company Ltd."" and additional information on Bassington Ltd. Lazarenko was a shareholder in both, dating back to the mid-1990s. Lazarenko was convicted of money laundering in Switzerland in June 2000 and convicted of money laundering in the United States in 2004 and sentenced to nine years in prison, later reduced to 97 months.

About a year after his 2012 release from prison, U.S. authorities seized his assets, including a Picasso lithograph and a California mansion once occupied by actor Eddie Murphy, to help satisfy outstanding fines.

The company the former emir acquired, Afrodille S.A., would hold a bank account in Luxembourg and shares in two South African companies, according to the lawyer. From September 2013, Al Thani was also the majority shareholder of Rienne S.A. and of Yalis S.A., which held a term deposit with the Bank of China in Luxembourg, according to the files. While Al Thani held majority ownership in both companies, a 25 percent stake in each was held by another family member, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar’s former prime minister and foreign minister."

In January 2015, Muñoz and his wife became named shareholders, owning 50 percent each. By that time, Mossack Fonseca had become the registered agent of Gold Black. However, only three weeks later, its compliance department proposed resigning because Muñoz was identified in connection with the governments of the Kirchners.

The first law firm contacted by Mossack Fonseca declined to process the loan, saying the borrower was refusing to agree to standard conditions in the mortgage documents. “There are just too many holes in this transaction”, wrote the lawyer. “I have concerns over the borrower’s objections here. Something just doesn’t smell right here in my opinion,” he added. But Mossack Fonseca found another lawyer who recorded the mortgage in Miami.

Reacting to criticism, Rivera disclosed she secured a $4 million, eight-year loan from one of Hinojosa's companies and made 30 percent down payment in January 2012, using her own money, almost a year before her husband became president. In her response, she made a commitment to sell the house.

In 2002, Makhlouf co-founded Syriatel, a Syrian mobile telecom company. He held 10 percent of the shares personally and another 63 percent through his British Virgin Island company Drex Technologies S.A. The same year, Makhlouf's co-investors in Syriatel sued him in Vienna where his Drex Technologies bank account held $2.6 million. He had also opened an account for Drex at HSBC in Geneva, Switzerland. Makhlouf also held accounts at HSBC for Lorie Limited,  Dorling International Limited, and Ramak Ltd., named after Makhlouf's company in Syria, Ramak Contracting & Trading. HSBC handled Cara Corporation, where he was a director; Seadale International Corporation, which he owned with his brothers, Eagle Trading & Contracting Limited owned by Hafez and Hoxim Lane Management Corp. for another brother. Beginning in February 2011, employees at Mossack Fonseca discussed via email allegations of bribery and corruption made against members of the Makhlouf family and sanctions that had previously been imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department. In June the same year, the BVI Financial Services Commission wrote to Mossack Fonseca regarding an investigation under anti-money laundering laws into Drex Technologies S.A., prompting Mossack Fonseca to cut ties with the Makhlouf family's companies."

Hafez, a general in charge of Syria’s intelligence and security apparatus, has been suspected of helping his older brother intimidate business rivals. Both were targets of international sanctions for their roles in Assad’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, although Hafez managed to unfreeze $4 million in Swiss accounts. Hafez lost his security post in 2014 amid rumors of feuding within the regime and is now believed to have fled to Belarus."

50,story-narrative,"In 2005, President Aliyev's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, was named as one of two managers of the Panamanian UF Universe Foundation, incorporated in 2003. Under a complex proposal submitted to Mossack Fonseca in 2005, UF Universe Foundation would have ultimate control of AtaHolding, a major Azeri conglomerate. The 2005 proposal named President Aliyev's three children in addition to other senior members of Azerbaijan's tax office as beneficiaries. Two secretive companies central to this proposal were established through Mossack Fonseca although it is unclear whether or not the proposal was ever adopted. The UF Universe Foundation was inactivated in January 2007, but in January 2014, its representative asked Mossack Fonseca to reactivate it. In addition, Aliyev's daughters controlled a Panama-incorporated company and two others in the British Virgin Islands. The Panamanian company held a significant stake in a consortium of companies exploring goldfields in Azerbaijan. Aliyev's sister was the sole shareholder and owner of a BVI company registered in December 2005. Registration records list her at an address in a West London neighborhood where average home prices touch $9 million."

50,story-biography,"The family of Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev leads a charmed, glamorous life, thanks in part to financial interests in almost every sector of the economy. His wife, Mehriban, comes from the privileged and powerful Pashayev family that owns banks, insurance and construction companies, a television station and a line of cosmetics. She has led the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, Azerbaijan’s pre-eminent charity behind the construction of schools, hospitals and the country’s major sports complex. Their eldest daughter, Leyla, editor of Baku magazine, and her sister, Arzu, have financial stakes in a firm that won rights to mine for gold in the western village of Chovdar and Azerfon, the country’s largest mobile phone business. Arzu is also a significant shareholder in SW Holding, which controls nearly every operation related to Azerbaijan Airlines (""Azal""), from meals to airport taxis. Both sisters and brother Heydar own property in Dubai valued at roughly $75 million in 2010; Heydar is the legal owner of nine luxury mansions in Dubai purchased for some $44 million. The president’s sister, Sevil Aliyeva, a longtime London resident, founded Space TV, a news and entertainment channel in Azerbaijan."

In October 2015, a report by Brazil's attorney general connected De Oliveira to Brazil’s Lava Jato (""Car Wash"") corruption scandal. In 2011, Brazil's state-owned energy company Petrobras bought a 50 percent stake of an oil field in Benin controlled by de Oliveira’s companies. Twelve of his 14 offshore companies were incorporated just months before his agreement with Petrobras. According to the attorney general's report, in May 2011, de Oliveira wired $10 million to a Swiss bank account held by João Augusto Rezende Henriques, a lobbyist for Brazilian party PMDB, through Acona International Investments Limited, a Seychelles company also registered by Mossack Fonseca in 2010.

59,story-narrative,"In 1999, Chiriboga, then a lawyer in private practice, was hired to collect a debt from a couple who owned a house in the exclusive residential area of La Viña. In November that year, Chiriboga created Madrigal Finance Corp. in Panama, and in December, in order to buy the house, the company granted him a power of attorney including “full authorization to set the price of the property.” Madrigal Finance purchased it for less than $2,800. The former owners later sued Chiriboga for fraud, as they estimated it was worth about $1 million. He finally prevailed, with the court ruling that the couple had not proven the property's actual value. From 2005, when he was appointed labor minister, to now as Ecuador’s attorney general, he has been inconsistent in disclosing his connection to the company when he declared his assets. Weeks before he took office as attorney general in July 2011, his wife María Victoria Espinal asked Mossack Fonseca to remove Chiriboga and other directors of Madrigal and to replace them with nominees supplied by the Panamanian law firm, although her husband remained the sole shareholder."

Julex was the shareholder of Stanhope Investments, a company incorporated in Niue in 2003. Ibori was also connected to Financial Advisory Group Ltd. and Hunglevest Corporation, although Mossack Fonseca’s files do not specify the exact nature of his connection. In 2008, Mossack Fonseca received a request from the Seychelles government to produce documents as part of a probe by the Crown Prosecution Service, England's principal prosecuting authority, of Ibori and alleged criminal activities. In 2012, Ibori pleaded guilty in a London court to laundering and fraud charges. During court hearings in the United Kingdom, prosecutors claimed that Ibori opened a Swiss bank account in the name of Stanhope Investments through which millions of dollars were later channeled to ultimately buy a $20 million private jet."

Ibori admitted using his position as governor to corruptly obtain and divert up to $75 million out of Nigeria through a network of offshore companies, although authorities alleged that the total amount he embezzled may have exceeded $250 million. Ibori, who received a 13-year prison sentence, used millions of dollars to support a lavish lifestyle that included six houses in London and a fleet of Range Rovers, Bentleys and Mercedes."

The companies were called “Best Effect Enterprises Ltd” and “Wealth Ming International Limited.” Mossack Fonseca helped Deng obtain a “chop” – a carved metal or stone seal often used by Chinese businesses to validate documents in lieu of signatures – for Best Effect Enterprises. It is unclear what the two companies were used for. At the time, Xi Jinping was one of nine men on the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, the body that rules China. By the time Xi was named general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012 and the country’s president in 2013, Deng’s two BVI companies were dormant."

FPB Bank identified Piskorski as a Politically Exposed Person and requested information about his agricultural business, including his assets and clients.

He said the money was a combination of his and his wife’s savings, credit and the proceeds from the sale of real estate. The report damaged his reputation and forced him to leave his party but resulted in no prosecution. In 2009, his reputation suffered again when it was reported he told tax authorities that his income was from casino winnings and art deals. In 2010, he was charged with forging a contract with an antiques dealer. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in Sept. 2015."

Court records show that Devillers held shares in the company on behalf of Gu and that the offshore company was used to secretly purchase a villa in the south of France. The $3.2 million used to purchase the villa was a bribe from a Chinese businessman for whom Gu’s husband had helped secure several business deals. Gu testified at her husband’s corruption trial that she wanted to keep the property secret in order to avoid tax but also because owning a luxury overseas property could have threatened her husband’s career. Her husband, Bo Xilai, was a rising political star and had been expected to ascend to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee in 2013. But in November 2011, Gu poisoned and killed an English acquaintance, sparking an investigation that ended with both her and her husband imprisoned for life. Before the murder, Russell Properties had been held by proxies in the offshore jurisdiction of Jersey. After the murder, Devillers became the sole director and shareholder of the company."

Devillers and Gu were co-directors of Adad Limited, a company registered in the United Kingdom, but Devillers also helped Gu set up a secret offshore company that was used to purchase a luxury villa in the south of France. Devillers was detained in June 2012 at his home in Cambodia at Beijing's request and spent several weeks in custody in China before being released. His testimony was used in the 2013 corruption trial of Bo Xilai."

X,about-intro,"<td>This interactive produced by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) explores the stories behind the use of offshore companies of politicians and their relatives and associates — more than 100 in all. Among them are 12 current or former country leaders and 33 other politicians and public officials with direct connections to structures in tax havens. Their names appeared inside a cache of 11.5 million leaked files from Panama's Mossack Fonseca, one of the biggest offshore service providers. ICIJ and Süddeutsche Zeitung led a global investigation to unveil their secrets, publishing the first stories from ""The Panama Papers"" on April 3, 2016.</td>"
X,about-blurb,"<td><p>ICIJ sifted through thousands of emails, documents and images to find names that were in the public interest. The year-long investigation unveiled connections to companies in many different tax havens, their uses and their real owners, whose identities were sometimes hidden behind layers of secrecy. The investigation found more than 140 politicians and public officials connected to 55 countries. The names displayed in this interactive are a selection of the most relevant cases. All of them include political figures or people close enough to political figures that they should have triggered extra scrutiny. There are legitimate uses for offshore companies, and we do not intend to suggest or imply that any individuals or entities included in the interactive were in violation of the law.</p><p><br/>The production of the profiles was complex and took several months. We combined a deep exploration of the Mossack Fonseca documents with research in worldwide public records such as company records, property records and assets declarations, among others. Purchasing real estate and yachts, holding bank accounts and keeping personal finances private were among the most common uses given for offshore companies. ICIJ reached out to all those in the interactive to give them a chance to comment. The answers we received are included in the profiles.</p><p><br/>Mossack Fonseca told ICIJ that it conducts periodic follow-ups in the case of politically-exposed figures to assure that no negative results are found. The company said that for 40 years it has operated beyond reproach in its home country and in other jurisdictions where it has operations. ""Our firm has never been accused or charged in connection with criminal wrongdoing"", said a Mossack Fonseca public relations officer.</p><p><br/>The Power Players is published in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and German. ICIJ media partners been allowed to select profiles they believe are of interest to their audiences which may result in similar interactives with fewer profiles. The information in the interactive is current as of April 3, 2016 and the offshore data up to December 2015. ICIJ will release the full list of companies and people in the Panama Paper files in early May.</p><p><br/>For questions and tips connected to this interactive contact <a class=""external-link"" href=""mailto:data@icij.org"" rel=""nofollow"">data@icij.org</a></p></td>"
